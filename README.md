The project aims to develop an automated tool for facial emotion recognition in the video file. Web application developed in Python 3.9.7 with the usage of Django 4.0.4 with REST API implemented using DRF. It is based on the already developed DAN model / link to respository: https://github.com/yaoing/DAN.

Both image and video modes are available. Pre-trained affecnet8_epoch5_acc0.6209.pth model needs to be downloaded and put into \ferapp\ml_model\image_mode\checkpoints folder.
